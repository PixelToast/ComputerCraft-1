Creating Protocals:
 -Any program put in the code directory can be called on by sending the server the name of the file with rednet.send().
 
Admins:
 -A protocal which is meant only for certain people, can use the "programs/auth" program to verify that it is an admin.
 -An admin can be added by executing: edit bin/admins
